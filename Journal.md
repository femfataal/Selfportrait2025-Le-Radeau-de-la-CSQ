Thought I could maybe use MDM on this painting that I keep getting stuck with and maybe learn something in the process? I found that I run/ran into a lot of potentially relatable design problems that could potentially be useful? Idk feel more than free to ignore me.
Doing this partially because my life is very much on fire right now, but I still really want to contribute, something, in some form?

any ways, long premise short, doing a dramatic-ish painting about My Feels™️ and currently getting stuck on technical issues while also working through some of interpretative bits as to what it communicates. 

Will post the progress pics right after this, but I felt a massive urge to make a painting about my experiences the last couple months, thought some kind of intepretation of Géricault's Raft of Medusa would be fitting and a good practice, maybe it would help me process some feelings, it could be a companion piece to The Battle of Vancouver (big ass drawing I did before), it could help me further explore what it's like to only work with one "colour" (gold), and to work on a big ass canvas this time (fancy)

(again feel more than free to at any point realize this server/theory is for academic game design stuff, and to delete the whole whole channel to keep the focus on games/real work)

^ some of the inspo 

- (2) Géricault, The Raft of Medusa, 1819, 491 x 716 cm (thats like super duper big), oil on canvas
- (3) Delacrois, Liberty leading the People (overdone, but canon), 1830, 260 × 325 cm, oil on   canvas
- (1) Baen, The Corpses of the De Witt Brothers (had to balance out the anti-royal/French flavours of Géricault with an extremely niche pro-royal/Dutch reference. Fun fact: the de Witts were from the same hometown as me. Google at your own risk), 69.5 x 56 cm, oil on canvas

⬇️ work so far, 

Figured out the plan and the sketch and the materials and ran into some first issues

notable: for some reason I decided to try and do an underpaint, by doing the highlights? (basically the end result of the last picture)

Still wondering what my exact thought process was here? Why did I think it would be a good idea to start with the lightest bits???? (Answer: because I forced myself to do SOMETHING, because I didn't really have a place to sort my thoughts, and this seemed to be the path of least resistance?)

anyways, realized that I worked myself into a corner with that move, and thought maybe I could make things better by lifting the entire hue of the painting by doing a thin coat of gold all over(ish) so that way I was working from a mid-tone base and not from the dark background colour (brown). 

This might have been another mistake....

started working on the skyline (still having difficulties working from a dark background upwards), but it did go relatively well. 

Still figuring out what to do with the goldwash situation for the other 3/4 of the canvas. 

Got the canvas up in the new place (I hammered in the nails for the canvas using my iceskate as a hammer (I am a crazy person, it did work really well))

**1-10-2025**

probably going to continue with the skyline bit, because rn its the easiest part. I decided that maybe I should change the lightbulbs back to the EVIL COLD WHITE ONES that came with the studio. It makes the place feel like an operation table, but the visavility is much better now (see before and after)
started working, I realized that I find working on this hard, because Im not really sure where to go with it. For now we're just doing this one tiny building I guess. Maybe I'll have a terrible time, but today has been rough anyways.
had the dumbest realizitation that buildings have colours too, and that maybe I should start mixing the background brown, with the gold to keep it 1 colour while creating tones

**11-11-2025**

the brown trick worked exacrly how I wanted it too. Did get very discouraged when I realized that when I set out to make a really big detailed painting, it means that I will have to do a ton of paining... And probably will have to go over everything multiple times...

Seems like one of my most typical "design" problems. Setting out on some big goal thinking: this is the thing that I want, how bad can it be? And about halfway in realizing oh no, I will actually have to do work now

another fun fact is that I enjoy living with the half finished project much more than I would expect. I was scared the subject matter would be a little too macabre for a living space, but its super abstract and also an iconic art reference. Plus it helps that I can just glance at it to ponder how to do certain sections, without having to actually do anything

Realized that having to go over everything perfectly one by one will be too time consuming and not fun. So I will probably turn to two of the oldest tricks in my book: generalizing and lying. 
Instead of making the skyline accurate I will just go with my accurate enough skyline and vibes, like I did in the Vancouver drawing, and work per colour instead of per building to be able to do multiple buildings at once. This will also make layering easier since the paint can dry while Im doing other bits. 
I feel like this makes the process managable again, and Im having fun with it again
(the Battle of Vancouver drawing I mentioned earlier, which is like 70x200 cm )
The skyline is unmistakably Vancouver, but no one realized that BC place actually has 3 levels instead of 2. So I guess creative architectural liberties might be forgiven if the overall vibe is similar enough
the shortcuts definitly work. Im finally seeing some real progress. The downside is that by working by colour instead of by building, means that the base building colour is going over my sketch lines, meaning that I will have to remember which building is which from the reference and what my general  idea for the building was again. It forces me to keep working, because Im scared I might forget which brown blob is which and get stuck, but it also costs way more mental energy than I thought it would (again the classic: making things is hard realization). 
I guess I kinda forced myself into completing a first draft of the skyline today through this method lol. Could be worse.
okay I finally have the whole city base covered. This took so much more effort and energy than I expected. Adding details should take less or will be more rewarding. 

Wondering if the skyline is recognizable enough. Not that I can do much about it, and whether or not I should put in the research to find out where my old Maestria towers should go (should probably do this at some point) 

These journal edits definitly help me vocalize and order my thoughts, strategies, and techniques, but I do also feel very exposed like Im letting people see that I am way more of a weird idiot that I let on

decided to split the details into one round of dark (pure brown), and a round of light (pure gold). Doing the dark rn, things are going quite well. I noticed that bigger details need thinner paint but the details need undiluted paints from the tip of the brush (all of this is incredibly obvious, but somehow Im only finding out now). 

I noticed that some of tbe actual iconic buildings like the 1000 will need the most attention to increase the chances of the whole thing being recognizable. 

Still think all the buildings are too wobly, but maybe I can fix that later on. 

Having fun with it again

Im quite pleased with the result. It actually captures the gold glow feeling that I wanted it to have. Will still need to add the massive searchlight on le 1000 and fix that boat guy (and the Maestria towers potentially). Very happy. 

It's funny that by adding that gold wash all over, it now looks like finished parts are kind of appearing like islands on the canvas.

**12-10-1997**

started to work on the sail yesterdaynight, because I wanted to move on the raft people as a little treat for myself today. I like how it looks, though I have also worked myself into a corner having the mast be background colour. 

Not sure what to do for the sky, as Ill need to figure out a way to tie together the raft and the city through the sky and the water, and Im really not looking forward to those part (especially the water is giving me intense flashbacks to frustratingly emptying out 2 goldmarkers on skratching in the waves in vancouver drawing)

(I do also find that the gold/brown mix sometimes dries a little gingery, but I don't mind, looks okay to me)

people base is now on, things look kinda terrible. 

Do really appreciate the composition of people on the ship and all the drama and despair in the body language of the original. Hats off to Géricault, genuine masterpiece.  

Wondering if I should do all the people in one go, so the skin colours will be the same (because they all have to have the same colour-ish in this version), or if it would be better to do them in the clumps in which they're sitting for accuracy

probably good to do a general lowlights round all over the people, and some MIIIIILD highlights (seriously girl, don't go crazy with the highlight like the last time.  We had to create 4 more problems just to solve that one)

also kept debating to include a Saturn Devouring His Son reference as one of the people on the raft. It would fit the overall vison and power stuggles onboard quite well, it would be a fun reference, and it would kinda keep in line with the canibalism of the Dewitt's & on the raft & in the meaning. 

It would also be very fun because it would require a reference pic of me recreating the painting (with a steak instead of a baby/god/person obv), and that is deeply entertaining to me. 

Though... Where to place this.. maybe right above the corpse at the bottom of the most right pyramid?

I mean... this is clearly me in my kitchen after a party. 
On the other hand, Im not that big of a fan of Goya (though the Witches' flight, is undeniably great)

doing the lowlights and realized I took way too many vibe shortcuts when sketching, the proportions and poses barely make any sense, everything needs to be fixed, and it will all take a ton of work. Classic. 
I'll continue the lights and then I might have to go over everyone one by one

sketching Femke of the past, why did you think current acrylic Femke was going to fix all the proportions? You could have set me up better here. Don't vibe out, use actual models and logic and sharper pencils or smt

I was staring at the goldwash all over and was wondering why I did this because it doesn't really work as a mid, and everything I actually want to paint needs to gets a seperate mid tone, until I realized that this might be because Im not used to working with a dark base. Pretty much everything I ever made, was on a lighter base. So the goldwash was probably my attempt to lift the background to something I could understand and work with again. 

Second, I forgot how forgiving acrylics on canvas can be after working a whole bunch with markers on paper. I can go over parts again and again, make it background, lift it back up, or wash over it and bring detail back out. Which is a way better time than the gold marker on white paper, everything kinda has to come out right in one go (though a great challenge)

I do also find that making this is an emotional outlet in the way I wanted it to be and in some unexpected ways. 
The expected point was to just channel all the dispair, frustration, sadness and rage about the whole immigration situation into something external. I find that working on it does calm me down eventhough it does require energy. 
It unexpectedly also gives me back agency and control, I get to decide what happens and I get to make the internal logic rules to adhere, while getting to see the whole thing come alive. Its really fun to slowly see my visual style creep into something I haven't really tried before, and while everything can still go wrong, I really like how that skyline turned out amd the first bodies/people are coming out decent too

**15-10-2025**

had a moment of sheer joy when having a video call in front of my work, and think ohh yeaa its starting to look like something. Did also realize that this will be a lot of work, so maybe just paint a bit each day during lunch break? And then do potential leasure session during the evenings and weekends. 

Had to buy more brown andimpulsively also bought a bunch of super fine brushes. I reeeeaaaly need those now. It's wild that Im working on a massive canvas like this with this teensy tiny little brush, but I need to get the detail of these people in. 

While I ended up not really running into the: distinguising brown blobs problem with the buildings, I am kinda facing it here. Luckily I have my reference, and I'll just do outlines that I can later hide with shades and highlights. 

Another part is going to be adapting the people on the raft into different me's essentially. Not really sure how to go about this and what references to use. Plus then theres also a bunch of different body weights that I hit during that time, and I just haven't really figured out what I wanted to do here. 

Still debating on the Saturn references, but skewing against it. I don't like Goya that much anyways. 

For now I'll just keep doing outlines so the people actually start to look like people

messed up this whole sections somewhow, these were supposed to be 4 people.. not 3? What happened? What was I thinking? Not sure...
Will have to fix this during a longer session during a weekend or smt

the people are visable now. There is a lot to hate. Terrible proportions, horrible composition, bad use of the white space, perspectives are off,
terribly bland and self absorded interpretation of the orginal, and just incredibly narcissistic amateur work that forgets and refuses to pick up very basic techniques.

But its already on the canvas, and its not a deliverable, so we'll just keep going. 

But yeah, definitly need to make more sketches in the future to actually figure out what it looks like instead of thinking I can just wing it. 

Will probably have to calmly go over each person individually in order to get the shading right. 

Im still REALLY not looking forward of having to figure out how to do the water, and to have that make sense in regards to the wind direction, or the sky, or the raft

**16-10-2025**

had a particularly bad morning mentally so decided to just paint a little. 

Created a horizon with ductape and used this new large slanted flat brush which was quite nice. 
One of my fears for doing the background was that the sail and mast would get totally lost in the sauce. Luckily this didn't happen. The sky is still not what I want it to be, but I can work with some dark moody clouds to give it all some more texture. At least things are happening. 

Will have to stop as I got an instense phonecall and will need to get ready for my day as well.

Will probably have to do at least the water at the height of Montréal all in the deepest background brown to make it make sense, but I have to be careful not to make the whole thing too dark

felt a wave of The Bad™️ so decided to just continue for a little bit freehanding the horizon (terrible decision)
The whole thing is getting way more brown now, and things are getting both more and less visable. I think its going in the right direction? I feel like Im adding structure for both the viewer and myself, and things are floating in space less

started doing some details on the first group of people/corpses on the bottom left. Constant oscillating between things are getting a little better! And This is absolute dog shit and I should burn the entire thing. 
I guess it is genuinely both getting better and worse?

also also, I just looove those over-exaggerated muscles of the romantic period so much. There does come a point where they go too far overboard and the subject start to look like a chicken with its skin peeled off, but eventhen it's just so fantastically dramatic 👌👌

**17-10-2025**

note to self: don't leave your brushes standing up in the water, you fucking dipshit.

I might just die from old-ish age before this painting is done. 
But some of the undone sections just make me mad by being not done. I'm going to focus on getting these people done with high- and lowlights and then I'll probably have to go over them again later on, the blend things together. I'm not uet sure how I'm going to do this. This is definitly a technique issue that I refuse to resolve up until now. From afar it looks somewhat decent

getting tired of making decisions. I think things are going quite well. 
Finally made the call to start clothing some of these people. It makes things both easier and harder. The clothes completely change the light, and Im too lazy to make references for myself (this is continues to bite me in the ass), but it also gives me a some room for cheating with the wonky proportions. Again, being able to go over things with acrylics has been great to fix small mistakes. I will probably have to go over everyone again for more details and then probably one final time to blend it all in with the raft.

Things could be significantly worse. I enjoy looking at this. Which is high praise for myself. Still have a mild urge to take it all down, but it's getting a little less again. 

Some of the undone bits do get me very itchy in a good way I suppose. It gives me a feeling that: I need to get back to this as soon as I got energy for this because I have opinions on how this should be.

PS I washed and dried the brushes

**18-10-2025**

Ive decided to adopt Pippin's strategy of doing a thing every single day. Strangely enough Ive banged out the two people on the bottom right in a quarter of what the two people yesterday took. Probably because I didn't have to think about clothes a lot? 
I not happy with how a lot of the people are turning out. Everything needs to better. But I need to make them exist first, and I can continue to go over them to refine later. I also need to figure out their hair at some point. 

Do I want to do more today? Yes and no. Im looking for easy victims to paint while listening to french yt videos. Louis Esquier has good speed (probably C1 level) for training my ear right now and forcing me to refocus often and quickly. 

Still staring at the thing looking for an easy next thing. Maybe this will be it for tonight

**20-10-2025**

did a quick power hour today. Added some clothes bottom left, and started working on the four people standing. 

I decided that Im going to cheat a bunch with these people, since theyre hanging out in the darkest part of the painting anyways, so I can hide a lot in the shadows. Though I will have to be careful, because it can make the entire thing look kinda lame and bland if it gets too dark. Still feel a very strong urge the burn the whole thing, but Im telling myself that it will be more satisfactory to do that once the thing is done. 

The water is going to be such a pain in the ass from a physics and technique perspective. I will definitly have to figure something out here

**21-10-2025**

having a very though morning for no obvious reason, so I decided to do a power hour to maybe calm myself down. Going to work on the main subject waiving the flag. I have no real reference so I have turned myself into the reference. 

I am currently wearing 2 pants on top of eachother and 1 winterboot, while trying desperately not to drink my paint water.... 
Truely the picture of mental wellbeing.

so the subject came out a little more dramatic than I initially wanted. The pants are also not dark enough, which I will have to fix later, as well as that I have to do hair and face contours. Its not THAT bad, but a lot of it doesn't make sense yet. 

I was able to shave off a tinny bit of the imposibly long leg. But I still need to fix it the leg/hip situation because it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. 
I like the hoghlights on the back. 

Note to self: the gold paint is much harder to work with because it is both much thicker, it dries really fast and it always start disolving again when in contact with water. 

We're slowly inching in some direction, which is nice. Some bits make sense, some bits don't. 

Still love the drama of the composition of people. Géricault really mastered the drama.

PS still think it's kinda wild how this is literally only 2 paints: Amsterdam burnt omber brown & Pébéo Studio iridescent precious gold. As Im writing this I realized these are 2 different brands of paint, which would explain the differences in how the paint behaves.. Makes sense.

**22-10-2025**

coming out of a sudden, but pretty bad wave of utter panic and anxiety (immigration and exam stress). Was able to squeeze in 30 min before I head over to my french friend here to hang out and practice. Kinda nervous ngl. 
Did just one figure and worked a tiny bit on the profile and clothes outline of another. It's okay. The quality of the work is still somewhat okay.

PS. was able to calm myself down back to functioning again

**25-10-2025**

Dragged my ass out of bed today, after a couple rough days. Im honestly a little too tired to even stand. But I do find the painting gives me some energy. I’m running out of easy targets, meaning that soon I’ll have to start doing another round of: making things make sense and making things exist. Which will probably be the raft and that sail that has been BOTHERING me ever since I put down the midtone. THe people are obv not done yet, but most of them now have their first round of high- and lowlights. In terms of faces people are still very wonky but at least they’re all looking into the right directions and a lot of the hard 3/4s actually came out well! Ive definitly been improving on bone structure, but far from great still. 

Coming up with the outfits for the people is also a strange process. I kinda do it based on the pose, recognizability, and if I think it’s fun to paint. 

O god I just realized I need to figure out these damn flags as well… uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugggggghhh. Donotwannadoit. 

As for the reason why I keep going on and on about having to do the water: first off, I sitll have mild traumatic flashbacks of emptying out 3 full gold markers when doing the water for the battle of Vancouver. It was such an insane amount of work, and I also made the mistake of going in unprepared thinking I could just wing it.. 
The second, and way more important reason is that I literally cannot shake the words of my art history teacher in highschool. She was the first to point out that in most of the historical pieces of the 17th century paintings (yes I know the raft of medusa was made in 19th century, but this will make sense in a second just wait for it) didn’t make much logical sense. Since at that time the only thing you could realistically paint with was oil paint, that had to be made and prepared in your studio (essentially by art RAs lol), it was impossible to take it outside, so your best shot would be to make references sketches and stitch those together(1/3)

Doing that is completely fine when you’re doing a nice little landscape somewhere with a cow or two, but not during a an actual naval battle, or in this case a post-disaster lost at sea. So you study what you can, and then just base it off of the vibes, because that is the actual best you could do. 

This changed with the invention of the paint tube in 1841, allowing painters to go outside. The raft of Medusa was made between 1818 and 1819 so the was no way for Géricault to paint outside. He did sketches at the Paris morgue and interviews with the survivors but obv he couldn't be there. 

Anyways, this, among plenty of other things show how some technical facts influence the overall look of the artistic style of the romantic period; stiching references together, making it all make sense in post, and put on a thick coat of vibe sauce, as well as the post-enlightenment sentiment of makings it all  yeeaaarrnn (probably why I love it so much). 

Anyways, the thing that my art teacher pointed out is that because of all of these reasons, you end up with a ton of incredibly beautiful paintings that look real, but that if you look how all the pieces come together (and especially the weather) do not make ANY sense. Which she pointed out with some examples. Most mistakes get made in combining very dramatic beautfiul cloudy skies with heavy waves (see the raft). The problem is: this is totally impossible. And literally ever since that day, I literally cannot unsee it. The water and the sky rarely match. It never makes sense. And then I learned windsurfing and how to look for the wind while on the water, and that has made everything even worse…. Because now the wind also doesn’t make any sense whatsoever. Not only does Géricault’s sea and sky not match, it is essentially blowing in 2 different direction simultaneously.  IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. 
And that’s okay, the raft of Medusa is and will always be a masterpiece and it is super dope and iconic. 

But I cannot unsee it. (2/3)

I will have to fix this. Somehow. Because if I don’t I will drive myself up the wall every time I look at it, and I will have to give this exact same lecture to every single person who will look at this painting, and that would be a terrible experience for everyone involved. 

But like, what to do? How to fix this? 

Like I will probably have to figure out the location of the reference MTL pic, figure out the direction of the st. Lawrence, pray the wind is going in the same direction as the painting or if not figure out if it ever goes that way, what that wind does to the water, then make it 100 times worse and make it a storm, and then figure out what the sky would look like in a storm like that? 
Like this will be like 3 separate studies that I have to figure out.

And that, is why I am complaining about the amount of work and procrastinating on sketching out anything other than the people on the raft  ✨

Also, love this question! I needed a second to think about it. So I have already created my paint set up in such a way that I can be painting in a matter of seconds, which I love. I guess doing a 30 min cram is kind of similar to trying to pull of a deadline, in the sense that there is no time to overthink or over do it. You take you idea and you just run with it. In that sense it’s nice every once in a while, but it is obviously no way to actually do an entire painting. Im pretty pleased with the results of it though, and I don’t think this section will bite me in the ass later on in terms of lighting, perspective or the details of the face. I guess sometimes decisions just have to be made without too much of a strategy

feeling relatively positive about where things are right now. Like this could eventually turn into something that would be cool in my house 👍👍👍

quite pleased with how pole/mast hugging girl turned out.

PS I once again do feel much better as compared to when I started today

**27-10-2025**

needed to calm myself down after a french class. 

Did a 50 min power hour situation, focussing on hair. Did a braid for the central figure, som flowing hair Im not happy with for the faceplant person (will need to fix this) and a half up half down hairdo for the topless reaching person. For the last one I had to cover the back, which was a little sad, since I really liked how those shoulders had turned out, but I knew that it needed some hair, and I didn't want to do another ponytail. Plus this hair looks somewhat interesting from the back. Im happy with the end result. It actually looks somewhat real

**29-10-2025**

I have my french friend come over for dinner in a bit and was nervous so I decided to do another 40 min power session. 

Did some very basic shading on the hanging cloth/sail situation, as it was an easy target and I though it would have ROI energy-wise. I completely made up the shading, which I do think will bite me in the ass later. because if you compare it to the sail behind it.... it's kinda blowing in 2 different directions.... 
(if you ever see this painting in real life, DO NOT point this out to me pls)
all and all, I don't think this session make thst much of a difference. 

I also realize that as an MD project, I noticed that this log sure does focus a lot on the making, and not necessarily on the conceptualization. Which is interesting. It's not that there is no development of the concept going on, I guess a part of me wants to keep it private because this piece is also close to me. 

That, and the fact that once I decided what I wanted: a recreation of the raft of Medusa, ft. me, with the skyline of MTL, as a means to process everything that has been happened and is happening to me. You can't really change that base. This concept cannot develop outside of these pre set boundaries. 

Though while working on it I guess my interpretations of the work kinda shift between things like: this truely is self-absorbed peacocking to the umpteenth degree, this is a pathetic but less harmful way to work through emotions, this is kinda meta as it is trying to depict a disaster while my proverbial raft is sinking as well, a time-capsule that is in-process, and that very strange human tendency of wanting to make suffering beautiful and meaningful by means of aiming straight for the moon and reaching for iconic european art as a means to elevate my misery, and then there is also just a very banale part of me that likes having a pretty gold conversation piece on the wall and a masochistic part of that would pick a way too recognizable painting to force myself to get it ..

**06-11-2025** 

will come back to all of the above sometime soon, HOWEVER I just got a call from an extremely excited friend back in NL. Who had to run out of a restaurant to tell me that our favourite artist Lausse the Cat has decided to drop a part 2 to his masterpiece album after 7 years of nothing. Im fucking hyped. This will probably be on repeat for the next 2 weeks. And would be perfect to listen to while painting. Im so hyped. My friend genuinely thought the artist had overdosed or something.

Can't believe it. 7 years

**18-11-2025** 

hello. 
I am back from the grave. 

I finally felt like I had enough energy to get up and paint again. Had some really tough weeks around my french exam and wasn't able to do any work. 

I did at one point have a phonecall with a friend in the Netherlands, who mentioned my painting as well. He has been watching some of the progress pictures I posted. That did kinda caught me off guard as in my head no one is looking at the pictures or reading the journal? I then did get kinda embarrassed at the fact that I'm definitly oversharing in some of these logs, though I'm not sure how else to do it honestly? 

Anyways, in terms of paint I finally started on the wet cloth covered corpse at the bottom. Ive been wanting to work on it for a long time, but I was never able to figure out how I was going to approach the look of wet cloth on corpse. I copied some details of the reference picture, but it is already starting to take a life of it's own. I did some line-outs with highlight gold, then a midtone of tinner gold and some highlights and fabric textures with gold gold again (I don't know how else to describe this). I'm going to move on to the lowlights next. Im really just winging this and just throwing on some paint, but like, it's not half bad

did I potentially mess thing up by totally winging this cloth situation? I don't know. I think I might have to revisit this bit later. 

Like how I will have revisit pretty much everyone on this canvas LOL 

There were also 2 things that my Dutch friend said that I thought were funny. He said he really liked the overal brown/gold vibe and was really surprised when I told him it was genuinely only 2 colours (brown and gold) for the entire thing. The second was that once he had figured out the scale he let out a big sigh and said: "That's so much work"

there something kind of interesting when doing a work like this, because it's so much work. It makes it impossible to only work when feel inspired or when feeling like you're up for it. You kinda have to keep chipping at it regularly or else you'll lose the thread and the timeline will become impossibly long. I guess that also means having to just go at it while tired or while not feeling it, which will influence the quality of the work. Im curious if in the end this will be a sort of averaging out of better and worse work or if it somehow does end up being good work?

alright this is going to be the first version of all of these people. 

I gues the next thing to do would probably be the raft itself

**09-12-2025**

started on some first bits of the raft. Still really not looking forward to the raft as it will require sharp lines and perspective. I used an Astérix comic book as a ruler and it turned out okay-ish. I might have to just completelt sketch out the raft in white before being able to paint it

**11-01-2025**

guess who didn't die?

Im currently in the middle of a session. Glad I got back to things. Getting to work is still a bit of a struggle. It still definitly works that I cannot escape the canvas in my place. 

Started of with a bunch of sketching. Had to use my yogamat as a ruler, as the horizon anchor points are way off the canvas, meaning that the lines I need to draw are super long. So I put the mat on the correct line, and the hold up the yogamat standing on 1 leg, and push down on the mat with one knee while also drawing the line. Sort off like a weird fighter pose lol. 

Did the outline of the raft itself. Not entirely sure if I feel good about the perspective and the proportions. I feel like the placing and spacing of the object is off; there is too much water and too little people and city. 

Will have to take actual reference photos once Im back in MTL. 

After doing the raft and sorta locking it in with darker paint, I was feeling the whole thing was getting a little too dark, so I got cocky and started replicating the sky. 
Now I feel like the whole thing is more unbalanced as the sky look like it's on fire [place smoke on the water reference/joke here]. Strangely enough it is technically painting accurate, the sky is kinda the brightest part of the entire painting. I guess I'll just continue to keep chipping away at it, and see if that does anything

I guess this block was partially mental health & physically being away & general instability, but also very much about having to switch modes doing something I know I quite good at; organic shapes, details, lighting, people, to the thing I lowkey hate such as perspective, straight lines, and more technical drawing (if that makes any sense). At some points I will also have to dtart working on the water itself, though now that I started on the raft, it feels signifcantly less daunting.

anyways, big props to Vadim, as I had the urge to start again for weeks, it was his casual: "oh are you working on that gold brown painting right now?" that tipped me over the edge and got me working again I guess

Im also just going to do that first flag. I realized that going for 100% total wind accuracy is ridiculous and I should also just be having some fun with it. So I just grabbed my flag, took a video of me flapping about, got a decent screenshot, did a line out to make things clearer and Im just going to work with that. The video is ridiculous, enjoy.

the flag outline is good, I think. I do feel like the top of the flag reads more as orange, and not red, potentially turning it into the "prinsenvlag" which is the "original" Dutch flag before the french came in, and that did get adopted by the NSB, and recently the extreme nationalist right... So I sure need to be very careful here. I do think that by just adding a bunch of shade, it will start to read as a darker colour.

did the flag. I find it interesting that following the folds and shades of the picture leads to more subtle shading than what I originally had in mind. Im not entirely sure whether or not I might want to follow this up with some more dramatic shading or if I want to keep it like this.

had a 3 hour call with my friend Jay about everyrhing and nothing essentially. At some point we were talking about the painting, and he commeted that: "well, I do think you gotta add some more texture to the water" and I told him I wasnt even near done yet in any sorta way lol. 

But yeah that got me to pick the brush back up. I guess Im ignoring my previous rant about wind and water accuracy and want to technically improve on the original. I guess the challenge doesn't actually appeal to me. In stead Im just going to try and do the water directly surrounding the raft, and then I can later blend it in with reference photos that I really need to have take this weekend. 

In order to do the water Im decided that it'll probably be best to do vague texture and tone washes, in order to create texture that I can build upon. This all sounds very fancy, but what it comes down to is just kinda wiping wet tissue paper with dilluted paint onto the canvas lol. Im seeing some texture and improvement pop up, but I also had to step back a could time to check if the light/dark balance is still okay. 

I feel like this entry is one of those times where Im talking very extensively about a bunch of gold blobs, but there is method to the madness, I hope. 

There is also something interesting about me being like: ahh lets just do it, in regards to the water, since I have been complaining about it a lot

the big wave behind the ship is turning out pretty okay. Though I will definitly have to correct the cloud behind the wave, because rn it's not making any sense. But then again, I will have to fix most of the sky anyways. 

Though very subtle, the wave experimentation is showing depth, which is a small succes. Like I'll probably just shave on it as much as I can before I feel like going mad. 

There is a lot of drama to it, and I do enjoy sitting down and staring at everything that's going on on there, which is a good sign. Still, just soo much more work to do

so I wanted to get do the flags while continuing to think about strategies for the water, but I missed my chance to buy the flags in Montréal. So I had to literally WALK to Québec. Since the Canadian Tire in Ottawa doesnt sell the QC flag, but the one in Gatineau does 😂 

got them, trudged back through the snow, only to find out that: the proportions of the flag are off??? They're too long??? Like what do you mean there aren't standardized dimensions for the flags?? You can see that especially the queb flag looks oddly stretched and there is not enough literal white space on the general CAN one. I mean, it's fine. I just need them to make sure I get the prints and the fold correctly and realistically. But still, this is so strange to me. Why is this not standardized?? Aren't the flagmakers not suposed to be more concerned about the flag?

PS don't tell anyone I let the flags rest on the floor ghehe.

Had a great morning with my Belgian friend Tabata. She was quite taken by the painting as well as the Battle of Vancouver drawing. We spoke a ton about displacement, national and personal dientity and being embedded in cultural/social systems. Really good time, but now my mind is racing like crazy and I need to calm down a little somehow, so I thought maybe working on the flag could be good? 

Came system as last time, took a bunch of videos and traced the main lines in Procreate. I though I could mimick the flag blowing direction, but it was pretty much impossible to have the flag both be recognizable and flowing in the same reaction, and also have that match the position of the arm. Which is most likely technical limitations on my end, but could also point to creative liberties taken by Géricault, which is mildly interesting.

started working on the flag outline, and realized that while the shape is right, it doesn't read as blue, especially since the Dutch flag has a darker blue in it. So now Im going over the blue parts with with a new midtone

working on the shading of the flag. Its a bit hard to see due to the lightning position & gold shimmer. But I guess its coming along just fine. Though unfortunately Im not getting to a point where to different techniques that Im using for different parts of the painting aren't matching anymore. The flags don't exist in the same visual universe as the people nor as the city. I'll finish the flags, but Im not yet sure as how to resolve this just yet

But I'm going to pause for now, as Im hungry and need to cook and move on with my day I guess
